**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
It is important to interpret the user’s needs and implement them into a program. You can do this by having client meetings, meeting with the stakeholders, and focus groups. Through these meetings we can create user stories that help keep the project on schedule. User stories allow the agile team to ask the client questions about portions of the project that they have. This also allows us to quantify what we are trying to accomplish for each part of the project.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Developing programs should be thought of as a team effort with each member of the team doing their own work. This process allows for the faster development of software. I really like the aspect of the scrum meeting and how they work. The reason that I feel like these meetings are so important is because I have been in so many inefficient meetings that could have been run so much better. No matter what you do I feel like a scrum meeting would be useful to incorporate.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
To be a good team member means that you complete your portion of the work when you are required to complete it. Whether this be writing user stories, managing backlog, developing code or anything in between by pulling your own weight the project can progress a lot quicker than being lazy about your work.
